      <description>Working at ATLAS involves a lot of student assessment data, including text responses. For certain projects, the data are sent to our team with residual HTML code in the text response strings, for example, It&#39;s might appear as It&amp;amp;#39;s, since the HTML code for an apostrophe is denoted by &amp;amp;#39;. To make these responses more readable, it is helpful to clean, or replace, the HTML markup with the equivalent symbols.</description>
