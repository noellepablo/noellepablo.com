      <description>IntroductionLast spring, I took a categorical data analysis course at the University of Kansas as part of the Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science graduate program. For our final project, we were asked to find a data set, form a research question, and conduct a series of analyses to answer that research question. While looking for inspiration for my final project, I found a Bechdel test data set containing the Bechdel test ratings for films released between 1970 and 2013 on the Tidy Tuesday weekly data project which was originally used in a FiveThirtyEight article titled The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywoodâ€™s Exclusion of Women.</description>

      <description>During summer 2021, I took a data visualization and acquisition course at the University of Kansas as part of the Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science graduate program. The final project of the course was to visualize real world data interactively by creating an R Shiny app. While brainstorming ideas for my Shiny app, I found a historical Olympic Games data set from the Tidy Tuesday weekly data project located in the R for Data Science GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>Working at ATLAS involves a lot of student assessment data, including text responses. For certain projects, the data are sent to our team with residual HTML code in the text response strings, for example, It&#39;s might appear as It&amp;amp;#39;s, since the HTML code for an apostrophe is denoted by &amp;amp;#39;. To make these responses more readable, it is helpful to clean, or replace, the HTML markup with the equivalent symbols.</description>
