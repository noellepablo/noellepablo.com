  Hi! Nice to meet you.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Hello! My name is Noelle Pablo, and I am a data analyst at [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems (ATLAS)](https://atlas.ku.edu/) at the University of Kansas. I contribute to the delivery of the [Dynamic Learning Maps Alternate Assessment ](https://dynamiclearningmaps.org/), a computer-based, accessible assessment system for students with significant cognitive disabilities. I regularly perform data analyses for research projects supporting the uses of the assessment. I also frequently collaborate with my colleagues to develop, implement, and maintain R packages, such as [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas).  I completed my B.S. in Statistics at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and my M.S. in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science at the University of Kansas. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and my 18-year-old Westie, Shaquille Bean Pablo. I also love eating and cooking good food, singing, playing the guitar and piano, fashion, traveling, and sleeping.
