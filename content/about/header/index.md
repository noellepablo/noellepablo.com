Hello! My name is Noelle Pablo.  I completed my B.S. in Statistics at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and my M.S. in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science at the University of Kansas. I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and my 18-year-old Westie, Shaquille Bean Pablo. I also love eating and cooking good food, singing, playing the guitar and piano, fashion, traveling, and sleeping.
