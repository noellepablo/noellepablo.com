<p>I wanted to share one of my project presentations from the last class of my masterâ€™s program, Statistical Learning II. This project involved building a decision support tool using <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/">patient record data</a> to predict the probability of hospital readmission. I used Shiny to build my decision support tool which featured an XGBoost model that I constructed using the <code>tidymodels</code> collection of R packages. In the presentation below, I briefly discuss the steps I took while building my decision support tool, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model building.</p>
